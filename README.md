# Introduction to React

## Overview
In this workshop, we will be learning the basics of the React JavaScript framework and building a sample project using the technologies learned.
* React encourages reusable, maintainable, and interactive front-end code.

## Learning Objectives
* Understand what makes React different from other JavaScript frameworks and JavaScript without a framwork.
* Install and setup React.
* Understand best practices for React setup.
* Introduce concept of state in React.
* Introduce concept of interactivity in React.
* Work on building a sample status widget.

## Introduction to React
React is a web framework developed by Facebook in order to make elements of user interfaces more modular and easier to maintain. According to React's website it is used to "Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs." 

#### Example: Facebook Reactions
* Imagine you worked at Facebook when they wanted to shift from using likes to reactions.
* Look at your Facebook and see how many different places reactions are used.
* Using traditional JavaScript, HTML, and CSS would it be easy and to implement these reactions in multiple places? Would there be repeated code between the different reaction components?
* React makes it easy to utilize UI components in multiple locations because instead of separating your HTML and JavaScript code, it uses JavaScript in order to write your HTML code.

#### Exercise: TODO MVC
* With the other people at your table, look at the code on the [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) website. This site shows the same to do list application written in a bunch of different front end frameworks. 
* For this exercise, look at the [VanillaJS](http://todomvc.com/examples/vanillajs/) and [React](http://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/) examples on their site.
* Vanilla is what developers use to refer to JavaScript that doesn't make use of a framework.
* If you know another front-end framework like Angular, VueJS, or JQuery, it may be helpful to look at their implementations after this workshop.
* On the side of the page, there are links to Github source code for each version of the code. Go ahead and look through the files and see what differences there are between the implementations. 
* At the end, each table will point out what differences they found between the React and VanillaJS versions of TODO MVC.

### Alternate Exercise: IMDBExplorer
* Same as above but with my IMDBExplorer app from my GA Code Sample.
* Pro: Much simpler code, similar to how I was envisioning the code for this workshop to look.
* Cons: Would rather not use my code, maybe not perfect implementation.
